## 1. QUAD Memory Management System

**Date Discussed:** January 2-3, 2026
**Status:** Implemented (Schema + Services)

### Core Concept

QUAD Memory is a hierarchical context management system that provides AI with relevant context while minimizing token usage (80-97% savings).

### Hierarchy Levels

```
Organization Memory (org)
    └── Domain Memory (domain)
        └── Project Memory (project)
            └── Circle Memory (circle)
                └── User Memory (user)
```

### Key Innovation: "Puzzle Piece" Logic

Instead of dumping all context to AI:
1. Send minimal initial context (~2000 tokens)
2. AI processes and identifies what it needs
3. AI requests more context by category (schema, api, business_logic, etc.)
4. System provides targeted chunks
5. Repeat until AI has enough or limit reached
6. Track which chunks were helpful → Improve future retrievals

### Implementation Details

**Database Tables Created:**
- `QUAD_memory_documents` - Stores hierarchical memory documents
- `QUAD_memory_chunks` - ~500 token chunks with keywords
- `QUAD_memory_keywords` - Keyword index for fast search
- `QUAD_context_sessions` - Tracks AI sessions
- `QUAD_context_requests` - Tracks iterative requests
- `QUAD_memory_templates` - Default templates per level
- `QUAD_context_rules` - Auto-include rules
- `QUAD_memory_update_queue` - Async memory updates

**Services Created:**
- `MemoryService` - Hierarchical retrieval, iterative context
- API endpoints at `/api/memory/*`

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Storage | Database (CLOB) | Flexible, queryable, can add RAG later |
| Chunk size | ~500 tokens | Balance between context and granularity |
| Keyword search | PostgreSQL arrays + GIN | Fast, built-in, no extra infra |
| Helpfulness tracking | Per-chunk scoring | Learn which context is useful |

## 2. Hybrid AI Task Classification

**Date Discussed:** January 2-3, 2026
**Status:** Implemented (Schema + Services)

### Core Concept

Route AI requests to optimal models (Claude for code, Gemini for understanding) using a three-mode classification system.

### Three Modes

| Mode | Accuracy | Cost | How It Works |
|------|----------|------|--------------|
| **Accuracy** | 95% | +1 API call | Always use Gemini to classify |
| **Cost** | 80% | 0 API calls | Keyword patterns only |
| **Hybrid** | 93% | ~0.3 calls avg | Keywords for obvious, Gemini for ambiguous |

### Keyword Patterns

**Claude Patterns (Code Generation):**
- Verbs: write, create, implement, build, generate, fix, debug, refactor
- Output: "give me code", "code for/to/that", "implementation"
- Context: .ts, .js, .py files, PR #, pull request

**Gemini Patterns (Understanding):**
- Verbs: explain, describe, summarize, analyze, classify
- Questions: what is/are/does, how does/can, why is/are
- Entities: meeting, standup, document, requirement

### User's Key Clarification

> "this score intent is not based on calls..its based on key words? once you take decision can we check with Gemini if this is correct..."

This led to the hybrid approach where keywords provide initial classification, but Gemini can verify ambiguous cases.

## 3. Multi-Provider AI Strategy

**Date Discussed:** January 2-3, 2026
**Status:** Documented (Partial Implementation)

### Core Concept

Use multiple AI providers to minimize cost while maintaining quality:
- **Groq/Gemini**: Cheap extraction, classification
- **Claude**: Code generation, complex tasks
- **DeepSeek**: Budget code option

### Cost Savings Example

| Approach | Monthly Cost (10 devs) | Savings |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| Claude Sonnet only | $450 | Baseline |
| Multi-provider (Conservative) | $61 | 86% |

### Tiered Pricing Model

| Tier | Cost/Dev/Mo | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Turbo | ~$5 | FREE tiers + cheapest models |
| Balanced | ~$15 | Mix based on task type |
| Quality | ~$35 | Claude-first for everything |
| BYOK | Variable | User provides own keys |

### User's Vision

> "Goal: 1M Claude tokens → 50M tokens worth of work"

This is achieved through smart routing, caching, and using cheap models for commodity tasks.

## 4. Infrastructure Strategy

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Implemented (Schema + Documentation)

### Core Concept

Provide flexible infrastructure options for sandboxes, codebase indexing, and code caching. All three strategies available, organization chooses based on needs.

### Sandbox Strategies

| Strategy | Best For | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Dedicated** | Enterprise, critical projects | ~$0.50-2/ticket/day |
| **Shared (Default)** | Most teams | ~$50/mo for team of 10 |
| **On-Demand** | Cost-conscious, async work | ~$0.01-0.05/hour |

### User's Key Clarification

> "can we suggest ticket grouping to sandbox... i like all three options.. lets code for all them and this is also configuration"

This led to:
1. All three strategies available (org-level config)
2. Ticket grouping for dedicated sandboxes (cost optimization)
3. AI suggests grouping based on: same epic, same developer, same domain

### Codebase Architecture Clarification

> "these client tables will be in their own gcp dev database.. we will only spin services and ui pods in sandbox pointing to their dev database"

Key points:
- Client's 200 tables → Client's GCP/AWS database
- QUAD's 150 tables → QUAD's database
- Sandboxes connect to client's database
- GitHub is single source of truth
- We store INDEX only, not full code

### Indexing Strategies

| Level | Storage | Cost |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Minimal** | File names + keywords | Free |
| **Balanced (Default)** | + Functions + AI summaries | +$5/mo per 10K files |
| **Deep** | + AST + Dependencies | +$15/mo per 10K files |

### Cache Strategies

| Tier | Size | TTL | Cost |
|------|------|-----|------|
| **Basic (Default)** | 256 MB | 1 hour | Free |
| **Standard** | 1 GB | 24 hours | +$2/mo |
| **Premium** | 5 GB | 7 days | +$8/mo |

### User's Comment on Storage Pricing

> "for 1GB of space this is the cost.. this will be much cheaper than 2TB subscription from apple for my iphone"

This validates our pricing approach - simple, transparent, much cheaper than consumer cloud storage.

---

## 5. VS Code Plugin

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Specification Created

### Core Concept

Free VS Code plugin that generates documentation using AI. Entry point to QUAD ecosystem.

### User's Vision

> "can we create a quad vs. plugin which can use this technology to create documentation directly in the project... first thing.. can we start this plugin project and just say we will help in the context just to document?"

> "we are not only web application.. we also offer api services from QUAD.. so yes.. in future will be doing things directly from VS esp for small business and enterprise"

### Key Features (Phase 1)

1. **AI Documentation Generation** - Select code, Cmd+Shift+D, docs appear
2. **10+ Language Support** - TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, C++
3. **Context Memory** - Remembers project patterns for consistent docs
4. **Free Gemini Integration** - Users use free Gemini API key

### AI Strategy for Plugin

User's key insight:
> "why claude for this can gemini do? it will much cheaper for the users if they use free token with their gemini key"

Decision: **Gemini first** (1,500 free requests/day), Claude as BYOK option.

### tree-sitter Clarification

User asked: "what is tree sitter?"

Answer: tree-sitter is a **code parser** (NOT AI). It extracts code structure (functions, classes, imports) fast. Used by GitHub, Neovim. We use it to understand code BEFORE sending to AI.

### Ticket-Level Chat Extension

User request:
> "i want to embed this thinking in our application too.. as part of chat functionality at ticket level"

This led to documenting the Ticket Chat feature:
- AI chat embedded in each ticket
- Uses same memory/context system
- Syncs with VS Code plugin
- Context-aware answers based on ticket + codebase

### Marketplace Strategy

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Price | FREE forever |
| Publisher | A2Vibe Creators |
| Website | a2vibes.tech |
| License | MIT |

## 6. Intellectual Property Strategy

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Strategy Document Created

### User's Question

> "check if we already have a document about cost saving algorithm.. we should tell this is also algorithm right.. please see is it just trade mark still or we can go for novice patent on full product?"

### Analysis Result

**5 Patentable Innovations Identified:**

1. **Hierarchical Memory Context System** - Org → Domain → Project levels
2. **Hybrid Task Classifier** - Three modes (accuracy/cost/hybrid)
3. **Multi-Provider AI Routing** - Task-based provider selection
4. **Tiered AI Pricing Model** - User choice of cost/quality
5. **Iterative Context Enhancement** - "Puzzle piece" approach

### Recommendation

| Action | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|----------|------|
| Trademark "QUAD Framework" | Within 30 days | ~$600-1,500 |
| Provisional Patent | Within 6 months | ~$2,500-4,000 |
| Utility Patent (if justified) | Within 12 months | ~$10,000-25,000 |

### Documents Created

- `QUAD_IP_STRATEGY.md` - Full IP protection strategy

## 7. Architecture Decisions

### Database Separation

**Decision:** Client data in client's cloud, QUAD data in QUAD's cloud

```
QUAD Database (Our GCP):
- 150+ QUAD_ prefixed tables
- Platform data, settings, memory

Client Database (Their GCP/AWS):
- Client's business tables
- Their data, their control
```

**Rationale:** BYOK model, data sovereignty, simpler compliance

### GitHub as Single Source of Truth

**Decision:** Index code from GitHub, don't store full files

**Flow:**
1. GitHub webhook notifies QUAD of changes
2. QUAD fetches changed files via API
3. Extract keywords, functions, summaries
4. Store INDEX only
5. On-demand fetch for actual code (cached temporarily)

**Rationale:** No large code storage costs, always current, respects source control

### Memory Update Strategy

**Decision:** Async queue for memory updates

**Triggers:**
- Ticket closed → Update project memory
- Meeting completed → Update domain memory
- Decision made → Update org memory
- PR merged → Update project memory

**Rationale:** Don't slow down main operations, batch updates efficiently

  - ElevenLabs (English, natural voice)
  - Azure Speech (fallback)

Calling:
  - Twilio Voice API
  - WhatsApp Voice Messages
  - Slack Huddles integration
```

### Multilingual Voice Support

User's insight:
> "if he types in english works but in telugu.. we should translate and explain back in telugu or any language.. so coding is not english any more"

**Flow:**
```
1. User speaks in Telugu: "ఈ ఫంక్షన్ ఏం చేస్తుంది?"
2. Detect language → Telugu
3. Translate to English for processing
4. Process query, get answer
5. Translate answer to Telugu
6. Respond in Telugu voice
7. Code stays in English, explanations in Telugu
```

**Supported Languages (Voice):**
- Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam
- English, Spanish, French, German
- Auto-detect from input

---

## 10. Multilingual Coding Experience

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Phase 2 (VS Code Plugin)

### Core Concept

Coding doesn't require English anymore. QUAD understands and responds in the developer's native language.

### User's Key Insight

> "so coding is not english any more.. you can speak to him"

### Implementation (VS Code Plugin Phase 2)

1. **Language Detection**
   - Detect input language from text
   - Support 10+ Indian languages + major world languages
   - Use Gemini's built-in translation

2. **Response Translation**
   - Code stays in English (universal)
   - Comments, explanations → User's language
   - Error messages → Translated + explained

3. **Example Flow**

```
// User types in Telugu:
"ఈ ఫంక్షన్‌కు డాక్యుమెంటేషన్ రాయండి"

// QUAD understands:
"Write documentation for this function"

// QUAD generates English docs:
/**
 * Calculates the total price with tax
 * @param price - Base price
 * @param taxRate - Tax rate as decimal
 * @returns Total price including tax
 */

// QUAD explains in Telugu:
"ఈ ఫంక్షన్ మొత్తం ధరను పన్నుతో లెక్కిస్తుంది.
 price అనేది బేస్ ధర, taxRate అనేది పన్ను శాతం."
```

### Language Priority

| Priority | Languages | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Telugu, Hindi | User's primary languages |
| 2 | Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam | Major Indian tech hubs |
| 3 | Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati | Growing developer base |
| 4 | Spanish, Portuguese | Latin America market |
| 5 | Others | Auto-detect capability |

## 11. Agent Behavior Rules

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Design Complete (See architecture/AGENT_BEHAVIOR_RULES.md)

### Core Concept

Constrain AI agent behavior by injecting "dos and don'ts" rules with each request. Rules are customized per agent type (BA, Dev, QA, Scrum Master) and can be overridden at org/project level.

### User's Vision

> "not only the requirement txt.. we also send agent does and donts for that request.. this do and dont are customized.. for phase 1 these are mostly configuration only.. i want to narrow down Claude thinking not to go out of boundaries"

### Key Points

1. **Per-Agent Rules** - BA can't generate code, Dev can't estimate, QA can't fix bugs
2. **Configurable** - Orgs can enable/disable/customize rules
3. **Prompt Injection** - Rules injected into AI system prompt
4. **Phase 1 = Config** - Mostly configuration, not code generation

### Rule Types

| Type | Symbol | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **MUST** | ✅ | "MUST ask clarifying questions before finalizing" |
| **DO** | ✓ | "DO reference existing patterns" |
| **PREFER** | ⭐ | "PREFER TypeScript over JavaScript" |
| **AVOID** | ⚠️ | "AVOID over-engineering solutions" |
| **DONT** | ❌ | "DONT generate code (BA agent)" |

### Design Document

## 12. Chat Message Queue Management

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Design Needed

### Core Concept

Allow users to cancel/deactivate messages they sent before they're processed by AI.

### User's Description

> "lets say user typed something which will be queued.. first message do this.. second message dont do this.. third message I changed my mind and do this.. can user delete these second and third from queue.. when the question is already picked up that means its ready for http call.. lets say we add 2 sec sleep time and give a button in the chat to deactivate or soft delete it shows up initially with strike and we will not do http call.. or if its done.. we will ignore that thread"

### Problem Statement

```
User types rapidly:
  Message 1: "Create a login form"
  Message 2: "Wait, don't do that yet"
  Message 3: "Actually yes, do the login form"

Without queue management:
  → All 3 messages processed sequentially
  → Wasted AI calls
  → Confusing responses
  → User frustration

With queue management:
  → User can cancel Message 2 before it's processed
  → User can delete Message 3 if redundant
  → Only relevant messages get AI calls
  → Better UX
```

### Proposed Design

**Message States:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MESSAGE LIFECYCLE                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Cancel Options:**

| Timing | Action | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Before 2 sec delay | Click [Cancel] | Message struck through, no API call |
| During processing | Click [Cancel] | Can't cancel, but can ignore response |
| After response | Click [Ignore Thread] | Response hidden, follow-up ignored |

**UI Elements:**

**Database Schema:**

```sql
-- Add to QUAD_chat_messages table
ALTER TABLE QUAD_chat_messages ADD COLUMN
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'queued', -- queued, processing, completed, cancelled
    cancelled_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    cancel_reason VARCHAR(50), -- user_action, superseded, ignored
    processing_started_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. **2-Second Delay**
   - Configurable per org (default 2 sec)
   - Fast typers may want shorter
   - Shows countdown timer

2. **Abort Controller**
   - Use AbortController for fetch
   - Cancel HTTP request if possible
   - If too late, mark response as "ignore"

3. **Thread Ignoring**
   - If message cancelled mid-processing, ignore entire thread
   - Don't show response
   - Don't include in context for next message

4. **Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Esc key cancels last queued message
   - Cmd+Z undoes last cancel

### To Discuss

- [ ] What's the right delay time? (2 sec default?)
- [ ] Show countdown timer or just [Cancel] button?
- [ ] Can users edit queued messages instead of cancel?
- [ ] Batch cancel multiple queued messages?
- [ ] Cost display for cancelled messages (saved $X)

## 13. Role-Based IDE Dashboards

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Planning

### Core Concept

Design role-based dashboards that feel like an IDE experience, not just a web dashboard. Each role sees what's relevant to them with restricted access to prevent micromanagement.

### Role-Based Views

| Role | Dashboard Focus | Can Drill Down To | Restricted From |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Senior Director** | Portfolio overview | Director dashboards | Individual tickets |
| **Director** | All projects in their domain | Project details, team leads | Individual developer work |
| **Team Lead** | Their circle/team | Member work, tickets | Other circles |
| **Operator** | Their assignments | Own work details | Other members' work |

### Dashboard Tabs/Components

```

│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Tabs

| Tab | Purpose | Who Uses |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **IDE** | Full QUAD IDE experience (like SUCCESS_STORY.md vision) | Developers, Team Leads |
| **Projects** | Project status overview, drill down | Directors, Team Leads |
| **Tickets** | Tickets assigned by project | All roles (filtered by access) |
| **Reports** | Analytics, metrics, trends | Directors, Admins |
| **Settings** | Personal preferences, widgets | All |

### Customizable Widgets

Users can add widgets to their home screen:

| Widget | Shows | Useful For |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **My Tickets** | Assigned tickets by status | Developers |
| **All Projects Status** | Overview of all accessible projects | Directors |
| **Team Velocity** | Sprint burndown, points completed | Team Leads |
| **AI Agent Status** | Running agents, queue status | All |
| **Recent Activity** | Latest updates in their scope | All |
| **Meeting Action Items** | Pending items from meetings | Management |

### Phase 1 vs Phase 2

**Phase 1 (Now):**
- Fixed tab structure
- Role-based access control
- Basic dashboard layout
- 2-3 default widgets

**Phase 2 (Future):**
- Drag-and-drop widget customization
- Save dashboard layouts
- Share layouts with team
- Custom widgets via plugin API

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| IDE-like feel | Tabbed interface with panels | Familiar to developers |
| Restriction model | Restrict drilling, not viewing | Prevent micromanagement |
| Widgets | Pre-built, selectable | Fast Phase 1, extensible later |
| Home screen | Customizable per user | Different roles want different views |

### Key Insights from Discussion

1. **End user UI should feel like an IDE** - not just another web dashboard
2. **Role restriction is about depth, not visibility** - Directors can see projects but shouldn't dig into individual ticket details
3. **Customizable widgets for login screen** - Some users want "all projects status" on login, others want "my tickets"
4. **Phase 2 will add more customization** - Start simple, add flexibility later

## 14. Multi-Platform Expansion Concerns

**Date Discussed:** January 3, 2026
**Status:** Planning

### User Concern

> "I am worried about Prisma now... we started small but this is bigger than I thought"

The project has grown from a simple web platform to a full multi-platform ecosystem:
- **Started with:** Web app (Next.js + Prisma)
- **Now includes:** iOS, Android, VS Code extension, and a services layer

### The Prisma Question

**Will mobile apps need Prisma?**

**Answer: NO.** Mobile apps are thin REST clients. They call the API, not the database.

```
Mobile Apps (iOS/Android)
         │
         │ REST API calls
         ▼
    quad-ui (Next.js)
         │
         │ Uses Prisma Client
         ▼
    quad-services (Business Logic)
         │
         │ Uses Prisma Client
         ▼
    quad-database (Prisma Schema)
```

**Key points:**
1. **Prisma stays server-side** - Only `quad-ui` and `quad-services` use Prisma
2. **Mobile = REST clients** - Just like NutriNine's iOS/Android apps call the Java API
3. **VS Code = REST client** - Also calls the API, doesn't use Prisma directly
4. **One source of truth** - All platforms use the same API endpoints

### Renamed Submodules (Shorter Names)

| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| quadframework-database | quad-database | Shorter, cleaner |
| quadframework-services | quad-services | Consistent |
| quadframework-web | quad-ui | "UI" is more accurate |
| quadframework-vscode | quad-vscode | Consistent |
| (new) | quad-ios | iOS native app |
| (new) | quad-android | Android native app |

### Phased Approach

| Phase | Components | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Phase 1 (Now)** | quad-database, quad-services, quad-ui, quad-vscode | Web platform + VS Code |
| **Phase 2 (Later)** | quad-ios, quad-android | Mobile apps |

### Why This Works

1. **Same pattern as NutriNine:**
   - NutriNine has Java API + iOS + Android
   - Mobile apps don't include database logic
   - All business logic is server-side

2. **Prisma is contained:**
   - Schema in `quad-database`
   - Client used in `quad-services`
   - Exposed via API in `quad-ui`
   - Mobile/VS Code never touch Prisma

3. **Scalable architecture:**
   - Add more platforms later (tablet, desktop, watch)
   - All consume the same API
   - Business logic centralized

### Decision

**Focus on Phase 1 first.** Mobile apps are Phase 2 priority.

## 15. Future Ideas Backlog

### Confirmed for Future Phases

| Idea | Phase | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Full project documentation generation | VS Code Phase 2 | Export to /docs folder |
| QUAD API direct from VS Code | VS Code Phase 3 | Ticket creation, updates |
| Multilingual support in VS Code | VS Code Phase 2 | Telugu, Hindi, etc. |
| Virtual Scrum Master | Platform Phase 2 | Daily standups, sprint health |
| Voice Assistant | Platform Phase 3 | Talk to QUAD |
| Proactive Calling | Platform Phase 3+ | QUAD calls when issues |
| iPad App | Platform Phase 2 | Split-view for management |
| Certification recommendations | Platform Phase 2 | Based on user skills |
| Google AntiGravity comparison | Research | Completed - see AI_PLATFORM_COMPARISON.md |

### Ideas to Explore

| Idea | Source | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Employee certification suggestions | User vision | Medium |
| Training cost optimization | User vision | Medium |
| "Does company use QUAD?" employer branding | User vision | Low (long-term) |
| Local AI models in VS Code | Discussion | Low (Gemini free is better) |

### User's Long-Term Vision

> "in future my vision is they will ask if company has QUAD... employee should be happy.. they should not ask if company use agentic to take call to join company"

Key insight: QUAD should be an **employee benefit**, not just a management tool. Track skills, suggest learning, optimize training.
