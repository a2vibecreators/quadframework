## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 3: Slow Enterprise Sales Cycles
**Mitigation:** Drive hosted tier growth, build strong community

### Risk 4: AI Model Quality Issues
**Mitigation:** Multi-provider support (add Claude/OpenAI as fallback)

### Risk 5: Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, SOC 2)
**Mitigation:** Hire compliance consultant, get certifications early

## Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap First (Recommended)

**Why:**
- Product already built (working prototype)
- Revenue starts Month 1 (hosted tier)
- Profitable by Month 6 (after first enterprise deal)
- No dilution needed

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-3: Prove concept (50 free users)
- Month 4-6: Land MassMutual ($110K year 1)
- Month 7-12: Scale to $170K-$420K revenue
- Year 2: Break $1M revenue (likely no funding needed)

### Raise Only If Needed (Seed Round)

**If you need to hire faster or expand internationally:**
- **Amount:** $500K-$1M seed round
- **Valuation:** $5M-$8M (based on patent + traction)
- **Use of funds:** Hire 5 engineers, expand sales team
- **Timeline:** After Month 6 (with MassMutual traction)

**Likely investors:**
- Y Combinator (if you want brand)
- Enterprise-focused VCs (want B2B SaaS)
- Strategic angels (ex-CTOs from finance/tech)

---

## Patent Strategy

### File Provisional Patent (BEFORE MassMutual Demo!)

**Cost:** $300
**Timeline:** 2 hours online filing
**Priority Date:** January 9, 2026

**What to Patent:**
1. Agent Rules System architecture
2. Progressive Human Gate Automation
3. Cost-Aware AI Provider Routing

- Cost: $5K-$15K (with attorney)
