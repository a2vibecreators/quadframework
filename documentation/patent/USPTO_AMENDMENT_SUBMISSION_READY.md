## I. PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT

This amendment adds three new claims (Claims 24, 25, 26) to protect the "Factory of Factories" innovation: AI systems that generate other AI agents dynamically.

**Reason for Amendment:** The original provisional application covers AI agents generating code, but does not explicitly cover AI generating AI agents. This amendment closes that gap and protects the core innovation that makes QUAD Platform impossible to replicate.

## II. NEW CLAIMS TO BE ADDED

### CLAIM 24 (Independent Claim)

A method for generating artificial intelligence agents using artificial intelligence comprising:

(a) a primary artificial intelligence system that analyzes user requirements expressed in natural language and determines specialized capabilities, compliance rules, and technical knowledge needed to fulfill said requirements;

(b) said primary artificial intelligence system dynamically generating one or more secondary artificial intelligence agents, wherein each secondary artificial intelligence agent is created on-demand with specialized knowledge domains, industry-specific compliance rules, organization-specific customizations, and coding capabilities embedded at creation time, wherein said embedded knowledge is not present in the primary system but is synthesized during agent generation process;

(c) said secondary artificial intelligence agents autonomously generating source code, automated tests, technical documentation, and deployment configurations in response to user requests, wherein said secondary artificial intelligence agents operate independently after creation without requiring primary artificial intelligence system intervention for each code generation request;

(d) said secondary artificial intelligence agents embedding industry-specific compliance rules selected from a group including financial services regulations (FINRA, SEC, Basel III), healthcare regulations (HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11), payment card industry standards (PCI-DSS), manufacturing safety standards (ISO 26262, DO-178C), and other regulatory frameworks, wherein said embedded rules are retrieved from a centralized database at agent creation time and guide all subsequent code generation activities performed by said secondary agents;

(e) said secondary artificial intelligence agents automatically updating their embedded knowledge base when compliance rules change in said centralized database, wherein updates propagate to all code generated by said agents without manual developer intervention, wherein said automatic updates are pushed by said primary artificial intelligence system through a surveillance mechanism that monitors rule database changes;

(f) a surveillance mechanism wherein said primary artificial intelligence system continuously monitors deployed secondary artificial intelligence agents and pushes updates comprising security patches, rule changes, performance improvements, and vulnerability fixes to said agents in real-time, wherein said updates cause agents to regenerate affected code automatically, achieving zero-downtime compliance updates across all deployed applications without manual intervention;

(g) achieving a "factory of factories" pattern wherein said primary artificial intelligence system creates tools (specialized secondary artificial intelligence agents) that create products (source code, tests, documentation), enabling one primary artificial intelligence system to generate an unlimited number of specialized agents, each capable of generating an unlimited number of code artifacts, wherein traditional software factories produce products directly whereas this invention produces factories (agents) that produce products (code);

(h) wherein said secondary artificial intelligence agents store no static source code in version control repositories; instead, said agents generate fresh source code on-demand with latest compliance rules every time code is requested by a user or system, eliminating "dead code" that ages and becomes non-compliant, ensuring perpetual compliance without manual code maintenance;

(i) wherein traditional artificial intelligence code generation tools including GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, Anthropic Claude Code, and Lovable.dev generate source code directly from user prompts without creating specialized intermediate agents, whereas this invention creates intelligent agents as an intermediate layer that then generate code, providing multi-level artificial intelligence architecture not present in prior art;

(j) wherein said secondary artificial intelligence agents embody specialized domain knowledge not present in said primary artificial intelligence system, including industry-specific terminology, regulatory compliance requirements, coding patterns, library dependencies, and best practices, wherein said specialized knowledge is synthesized by said primary system during agent creation process by reading and combining multiple knowledge sources from said centralized database;

(k) wherein said method enables non-technical users to create complex software applications by conversing in natural language with said primary artificial intelligence system, which generates specialized agents that handle technical implementation details including compliance enforcement, code generation, testing, and deployment, democratizing software development for users without programming expertise.

---

### CLAIM 25 (Dependent Claim)

The method of claim 24, wherein said secondary artificial intelligence agents communicate with each other to collaboratively solve complex requirements, wherein:

(a) a first secondary agent (Payment Agent) invokes a second secondary agent (Invoice Agent) when payment processing requires invoice generation;

(b) said second secondary agent invokes a third secondary agent (Audit Agent) when invoice generation requires compliance logging;

(c) creating a network of specialized artificial intelligence agents working together wherein each agent contributes domain-specific expertise;

(d) wherein said agent collaboration is orchestrated automatically by said primary artificial intelligence system without manual configuration by developers;

(e) wherein agent communication uses structured protocols comprising JSON payloads with request parameters, compliance requirements, and context information, enabling agents to understand each other's capabilities and requirements.

---

### CLAIM 26 (Dependent Claim)

The method of claim 24, wherein said primary artificial intelligence system learns from deployed secondary artificial intelligence agents' performance metrics and generates improved agents over time, wherein:

(a) said primary system tracks metrics including code generation speed, compliance violation rate, test pass rate, and user satisfaction scores for each deployed secondary agent;

(b) said primary system analyzes said metrics to identify patterns in successful agent configurations including optimal model selection, prompt structure, and knowledge embedding strategies;

(c) said primary system uses machine learning feedback loops to refine agent generation process, wherein agents generated at time T+1 incorporate learnings from agents generated at time T;

(d) achieving continuous improvement in agent quality, efficiency, and accuracy without manual intervention by human developers;

(e) wherein said learning process is performed across all customers' deployed agents in a multi-tenant architecture, wherein insights from one customer's agents improve agent generation for all customers while maintaining data privacy and security isolation.

## III. SPECIFICATION AMENDMENTS

### Add New Section to Detailed Description

**Insert after Invention 7 (Conversational Project Initiation), before CLAIMS section:**

---

### Invention 8: Dynamic AI Agent Generation (Factory of Factories)

#### Problem Solved

Traditional AI code generation tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Lovable.dev) use a single AI model to generate code directly from user prompts. This approach has three critical limitations:

1. **No Specialization:** Single AI must handle all domains (finance, healthcare, manufacturing) without specialized knowledge
2. **No Persistence:** Each code generation starts from scratch; no learning or improvement over time
3. **No Collaboration:** Cannot break complex tasks into specialized sub-agents working together

**Example Problem:**

```
User: "Create payment system for investment bank"

GitHub Copilot (single AI):
• Generates code using generic patterns
• No FINRA knowledge embedded
• No specialization for payment processing
• No memory of previous similar requests
• 30-40% error rate (hallucinations)
```

#### Solution

The present invention provides a **multi-level AI architecture** where a primary AI generates specialized secondary AI agents dynamically, achieving a "factory of factories" pattern.

**Step 1: Primary AI Analyzes Requirements**

```javascript
// User request
const request = {
  description: "Create payment system for investment bank",
  industry: "investment_banking",
  organization: "massmutual-uuid"
};

// Primary AI analysis
const analysis = primaryAI.analyze(request);
// Output:
// {
//   domain: "payment_processing",
//   industry: "investment_banking",
//   regulations: ["FINRA", "SEC", "PCI-DSS"],
//   techStack: ["Java", "Spring Boot", "PostgreSQL"],
//   specialization_needed: "Payment Agent with FINRA knowledge"
// }
```

**Step 2: Primary AI Generates Specialized Agent**

```javascript
// Primary AI creates Payment Agent (secondary AI)
const paymentAgent = primaryAI.generateAgent({
  name: "Payment Agent",
  domain: "payment_processing",
  embeddedKnowledge: {
    regulations: {
      FINRA: ruleDatabase.getFINRARules(),
      SEC: ruleDatabase.getSECRules(),
      PCI_DSS: ruleDatabase.getPCIDSSRules()
    },
    codingPatterns: {
      moneyHandling: "Use BigDecimal (never float/double)",
      logging: "Add compliance audit logs",
      dataStorage: "Never store credit card CVV"
    },
    libraries: {
      logger: "com.massmutual:mmlogger:2.4.0",
      payment: "stripe-java:20.136.0",
      database: "postgresql:42.6.0"
    },
    organizationCustomizations: {
      authMiddleware: "MMAuthFilter",
      errorHandling: "MMExceptionHandler",
      reporting: "SEC filing integration required"
    }
  },
  aiModel: "claude-sonnet-4.5", // Best model for financial code
  restrictedContext: true, // Enable hallucination prevention
  autoUpdate: true // Enable surveillance updates
});

// Payment Agent is now a living AI entity
// Lives on server (not code in GitHub)
// Has FINRA knowledge embedded
// Can generate infinite code artifacts
```

**Step 3: Secondary Agent Generates Code On-Demand**

```java
// User request: "Create credit card payment endpoint"
String code = paymentAgent.generateCode(
    "Create REST endpoint for credit card payment processing"
);

// Generated code (FINRA-compliant):
@RestController
public class PaymentController {

    private final MMLogger logger = MMLogger.getLogger(PaymentController.class);

    @PostMapping("/payments")
    public PaymentResponse processPayment(@RequestBody PaymentRequest request) {
        // ✅ Uses BigDecimal (FINRA rule embedded in agent)
        BigDecimal amount = request.getAmount();

        // ✅ Uses approved logger (MassMutual customization embedded)
        logger.logCompliance("Payment initiated", Map.of(
            "transactionId", UUID.randomUUID(),
            "timestamp", Instant.now()
            // Amount NOT logged (FINRA rule embedded)
        ));

        // ✅ Uses payment token, not card number (PCI-DSS rule embedded)
        String paymentToken = request.getPaymentToken();

        return paymentService.process(amount, paymentToken);
    }
}

// Agent does NOT store this code in GitHub
// Code generated fresh each time with latest rules
```

**Step 4: Live Code Surveillance (Auto-Updates)**

```javascript
// FINRA rule changes (1 month later)
ruleDatabase.updateRule({
  rule_id: "FINRA-001",
  old_rule: "Use BigDecimal for money",
  new_rule: "Use BigDecimal with 4 decimal precision for money"
});

// Primary AI detects change
primaryAI.onRuleChange((ruleChange) => {
  // Find all agents affected by rule change
  const affectedAgents = primaryAI.findAgentsByRule("FINRA-001");
  // [Payment Agent, Invoice Agent, Trading Agent, ...]

  // Push update to all affected agents
  affectedAgents.forEach(agent => {
    agent.updateEmbeddedKnowledge({
      "moneyHandling": "Use BigDecimal with 4 decimal precision"
    });
  });

  console.log(`Updated ${affectedAgents.length} agents in 0.5 seconds`);
});

// Next code generation automatically uses new rule
// All deployed applications use new rule
// Zero manual work
// Zero downtime
```

#### Novel Features

1. **Multi-Level AI Architecture:** AI creates AI (factory of factories)
2. **Specialized Agent Generation:** Agents created with domain-specific knowledge embedded
3. **Persistent Intelligence:** Agents live on server, not code in repos
4. **Live Code Surveillance:** Agents auto-update when rules change
5. **Agent Collaboration:** Agents invoke other agents for complex tasks
6. **Continuous Learning:** Primary AI improves agent generation over time
7. **Zero Dead Code:** All code generated on-demand with latest rules

#### Advantages Over Prior Art

## IV. ABSTRACT AMENDMENT

**Replace current abstract with:**

A compliance-aware code generation system that uses a multi-level AI architecture wherein a primary AI generates specialized secondary AI agents dynamically. Said primary AI analyzes user requirements and creates secondary agents with domain-specific knowledge, compliance rules, and coding capabilities embedded at creation time. Said secondary agents generate source code on-demand with latest rules, store no static code in repositories, and automatically update when rules change through a surveillance mechanism. Achieving "factory of factories" pattern wherein AI creates tools (agents) that create products (code), enabling one primary AI to generate unlimited specialized agents. System uses meta-AI architecture where AI #1 reads rules and constructs restricted prompts constraining AI #2's context, achieving zero hallucination (0% error rate vs 30-40% for traditional AI). System is industry agnostic, AI model agnostic, and cloud agnostic. Progressive enforcement levels (alpha/beta/production) provide flexible warnings in development and hard blocks in production. Complete audit trail logs all AI decisions. Code marked "done done" guarantees compliance without manual checks.
