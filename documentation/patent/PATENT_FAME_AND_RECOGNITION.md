## Comparison: Patent vs Product

### Just Patent (No Product):

**Example:** Someone files patent, never builds product, never commercializes

**Fame:** 0/10 (literally no one knows or cares)

**Value:**
- Patent expires worthless
- No revenue, no recognition
- Waste of $10K-$20K patent attorney fees

**Chandrababu Naidu:** Never hears your name

---

### Patent + Product + Revenue:

**Example:** You build QUAD Platform, get 100 customers, $10M revenue, patent granted

**Fame:** 5/10 (tech industry knows)

**Value:**
- Patent has commercial value ($100M+ if enforced against Microsoft)
- Revenue = financial freedom
- Recognition in tech community
- Investor interest

**Chandrababu Naidu:** Might invite to tech summit if you pitch him

---

### Patent + Unicorn Exit:

**Example:** You build QUAD, Microsoft acquires for $1B, or IPO at $5B valuation

**Fame:** 9/10 (national icon)

**Value:**
- Patent was KEY to $1B valuation (defensible IP)
- You're now billionaire (₹8,000 crore)
- National recognition (Forbes, Economic Times)
- Political recognition (Chandrababu Naidu, PM Modi)

**Chandrababu Naidu:** Personally calls to congratulate, invites to Amaravati
